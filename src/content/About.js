                Hey everyone! My name is AJ and I love to build and use software applications. I think the 21st century has inspired an overhaul in the meaning of artistry, one of which is that programming has arguably become the most relevant creative practice on a global scale. When I'm not coding I like to play my piano, read and write, and daydream about totally unrealistic things.
