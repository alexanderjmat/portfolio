                    Hey everyone! My name is AJ and I love to build and use software applications.

When I'm not coding I like to <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64ZAMjztXtE">play my piano</Link>, <Link href="https://medium.com/@alexanderjmatula">read and write</Link>, and daydream about totally unrealistic things.
